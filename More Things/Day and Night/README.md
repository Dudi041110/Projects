Yo.
So I guess you found my first project ("Day and Night")
Its basically this platformer where your a cube and your just venturing through your land fighting ghosts and shi, like the average Joe.
Its still a work in progress though.
To give you some history on the game; I started making it about a year or 2 ago on scratch before I learnt python, so then I switched over to coding it on python.
But like, its pretty difficult for me to ode a game of this magnitude(?) on python so I've really been struggling.
I'm trying my best though so I really hope you enjoy my game.
Currently I'm working on the combat system so I guess you should come back here in some time to see if the game improved.
Anyways you probably want to know how to run it so here:
# How to run the file
After extracting the folder.
Open the dist folder and run the .exe file you see.
Its not a virus.
I promise.
K. Toodles.
