                    This is the update log for my game Day and Night. It starts from version 0.0.3 cause this website was only made on this version.

                <span class = "line-with-text">NEW ADDITIONS</span>
                > Started the creation of World 2.<br>
                > Added rooms 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 (Rooms over 18 (excluding 18) are a part of World 2).<br>
                > Added the World 1 Boss (Ghost King).<br>
                > Added a new enemy (Gremlin).<br>
                > Added custom ground effects (currently there is only a conveyor but moving ground and such are planned).<br>
                > Added a portal to World 2.<br>
                > New ground color and background for World 2.<br>
                > Added checkpoints to the new rooms.<br>
                <span class = "line-with-text">IMPROVEMENTS</span>
                > Made it so all enemies actually effects the players points.<br>
                > Made it so killing enemies heals the player (This was already implemented on the ghost).<br>
                > Lowered the amount of invulnerability frames after taking damage.<br>
                > Fixed a bug where the player wouldnt turn back from red after taking damage from the skeleton.<br>
                > Lowered the time the skeleton's attack lasts by 0.5 seconds.<br>
                > Updated the layering so the player always displays infront of the enemies.<br>
                <span class = "line-with-text">NOTES</span>
                > I have switched from a daily update schedule to a system of just rolling out updates when they are ready rather than just uploading a few lines a day that are mostly meaningless.<br>
                > Sprites will be added later... (I can't draw)<br>
                > I have also mostly forgotten about the readme files and they will most likely be deleted soon or reworked to always redirect you to this website (not this exact page though).
